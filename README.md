# About Me

Hello — I´m an audiovisual journalist and motion graphics designer based in Santiago, Chile. I am passionate about telling stories using different languages and formats. I'm on GitHub to get to know the platform and get closer to collaborative work with programming languages. 

I currently work as a designer at Reactor, a strategic communications agency in my country. I´m also a professor of the course Narración Gráfica de No Ficción (Non Fiction Graphic Narrative), at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.
